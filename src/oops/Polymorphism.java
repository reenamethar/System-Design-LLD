 * Polymorphism -> the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 
 * allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
 * Types of Polymorphism
 * 1.Compile-time Polymorphism (static polymorphism)
 * This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
 * Method Overloading-> When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.
 * (sub type of compile-time polymorphism -> method overloading and operator overloadings
 *  
 * 2. Runtime Polymorphism
 * a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime.
 * (sub type of runtime polymorphism)Virtual functions: It allows an object of a derived class to behave as if it were an object of the base class.
