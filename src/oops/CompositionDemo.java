 * Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.  

It represents part-of relationship.
In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.

 * In below example A company have a number of departments
 * all departments are part of the company
 * if company gets destroyed then all departments within that company will be destroyed
 * thatâ€™s why it is composition. Department is Part-of Company.
